### Emergency Dental Care

Even with an optimal oral hygiene routine in place, unexpected dental issues can arise. One of the most common problems that result in the need for immediate emergency dental care is teeth sensitivity. Such a situation can result from any of the following:

*	Tooth decay
*	Cavities
*	Chipped teeth
*	Gingivitis
*	Gum issues
*	Abscess


In such cases, immediate action is important to eliminate pain and reduce the risk of the condition worsening. Our emergency dental care service provides a convenient option for addressing such issues quickly.

### Teeth Cleaning

Teeth cleaning is usually the first service that many of our patients experience. A thorough teeth cleaning helps remove stains and reduces the risk of cavities.

### Invisalign

Invisalign utilizes clear teeth aligners that are less noticeable than metal braces. They are also removable, making them an excellent choice for those who prefer versatility. Our dentist may recommend evaluating your Invisalign aligners every few weeks to ensure the process is carried out effectively.

### Crowns

Crowns are covers for your teeth that protect them from further damage. This device is commonly used with treatments designed to cure abscesses because they protect the weakened tooth from cracks and chips. There are several types of crowns, and we suggest that you schedule an appointment so that our dentist can determine if a crown is the right solution for you.
